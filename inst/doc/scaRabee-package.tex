\pkg{scaRabee} is a toolkit for modeling and simulation primarily intended for
the field of pharmacometrics. This package is a R port of Scarabee, a 
Matlab-based piece of software developed as a fairly simple application for the
simulation and optimization of pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic models 
specified with explicit solutions, ordinary or delay differential equations.

The method of optimization used in scaRabee is based upon the Nelder-Mead simplex
algorithm, as implemented by the \code{fminsearch} function from the
\pkg{neldermead} package.

Please, refer to the vignette to learn how to run analyses with \pkg{scaRabee} 
and read more about the methods used in \pkg{scaRabee}.

\pkg{scaRabee} is  available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network and also at:
